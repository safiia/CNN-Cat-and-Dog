** Instructions **

To run model one type: python main.py model_one <br />
#which is a model classification of cats and dogs using CNN with 2 convolution layers and 2 fully connected layers.<br />
To run model two type: python main.py model_two: <br />
##it is file contains classification of cat and dog using CNN with 4 convolution layers and 2 fully connected layers <br />

** Using Tensorboard to visualize the output ** <br />
This is the images visulized by tensorboard:<br />
